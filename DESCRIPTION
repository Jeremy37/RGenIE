Title: RGenie - analysis of GenIE experiments
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: as.person("Jeremy Schwartzentruber <jeremy37@gmail.com> [aut, cre]")
Description: The R package for GenIE analysis is designed to analyze the next-generation sequencing
    output from a set of GenIE experimental replicates. GenIE (genome-editing interrogation of enhancers)
    is an experimental method to evaluate the effects of individual SNPs on gene transcription. It is
    based on targeted CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in cultured cells to produce indels at a target locus,
    optionally with a homology-dependent recombination (HDR) construct to create precisely defined genomic
    changes. Following this, both genomic DNA (gDNA) and RNA are extracted from the same pool of cells,
    then cDNA is generated. Both gDNA and cDNA are amplified with locus-specific PCR primers, in multiple
    replicates, and libraries of the experimental replicates are prepared for next-generation sequencing.
    The sequencing data from each replicate for each region should be aligned to either the full reference
    genome or to a locus-specific (amplicon) reference genome for analysis by RGenie.
