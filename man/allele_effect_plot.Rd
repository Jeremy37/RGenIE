\title{Plots estimated effect sizes and confidence intervals for top alleles from a alignment analysis.}
\usage{
allele_effect_plot(
  alignment_result,
  viewing_window = 40,
  max_alleles = 40,
  min_read_count = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alignment_result}{Result from a call to alignment_analysis.}

\item{viewing_window}{Window on either size of the CRISPR cut site to show in the plot.}

\item{max_alleles}{The maximum number of alleles to show in the plot.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot object plotting effect sizes and confidence intervals for top alleles
 from a alignment analysis.
Top alleles are in decreasing order of their total read count in gDNA across replicates.
